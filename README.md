# Java Simple RSA Implementation
This is a simple implementation of RSA cipher, capable of encrypting and decrypting about 900 bits(if 1024 chosen as pulic-key bit length) at a time.

Please DON'T use it in commercial applications, since RSA encrypted messages without padding are reportedly found highly vulnerable to attacks, see [Definition of Textbook RSA](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1448/definition-of-textbook-rsa).
